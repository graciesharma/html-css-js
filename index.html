            <h2><span class="text-primary">How will AI replace human work ?</h2>
            <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is gaining a lot of traction in recent times. This is mainly because it has broken the bottleneck of human efficiency, reduced repetitive work, and enhanced work efficiency. As a result, almost every industry in the world is planning to leverage AI or has already implemented it in their business.

            However, implementing AI can also lead to the elimination of a lot of human jobs. In fact, in areas such as medical diagnosis, speech translation, and accounting, AI has outperformed humans in every way imaginable. Thus, there is this underlying fear that AI will one day take over most of the jobs in the world.</p>
